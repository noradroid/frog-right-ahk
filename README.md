# Right-handed FrogPad layout on AutoHotKey

This layout uses AHKv1.1 ([download here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/1.1/)).

Original AHK file was created by Clark at [github.com/clarkm/dupepad](https://github.com/clarkm/dupepad).

I made the following changes in this version:
- Removed primary key mappings for:
  - RAlt: enter
  - LShift + z: <
  - LShift + x: >
- Removed secondary key mappings for:
  - y -> quote (')
- Changed secondary key mappings for:
  - b: delete forward -> comma (,)
  - n: backspace / delete backward -> period (.)
  - RAlt: period (.) -> <
  - RCmd: comma (,) -> >
- Added hold RShift to type in uppercase
